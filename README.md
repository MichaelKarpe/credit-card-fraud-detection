# A comparitive study of different machine and deep learning outlier detection algorithms for credit card fraud detection

This year-end project has been realized from February 2018 to May 2018 during my second year at *École des Ponts ParisTech* in _Applied Mathematics and Computer Science_, in collaboration with Jiali Xu, Quantitative Analyst at *Société Générale - Corporate and Investment Banking*.

The aim of this project was to realize a comparative study between different outlier detection algorithms to select the one that had the best performances on a credit card fraud dataset. After some research, we decided to focus our study on the following algorithms:
- Robust Estimator of Covariance
- Local Outlier Factor
- One-class SVM
- Isolation Forest
- Autoencoder

The code is currently being cleaned by myself, and will come soon with the different presentation slides and the final report we made for this year-end project.
